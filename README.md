## Wireframes

High-fidelity wireframes to demonstrate how the final product could look were created and can be viewed [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/599b62f7-9972-4b4e-55b9-dce92bf4cd81-2faa/).

<a name="testing"></a>
## Testing

JUnit, Mockito and selenium tests have been used for automated testing, and SonarQube for static analysis and ECLEmma for test coverage.

Test coverage for the backend services achieves a minimum of 70%, there are as of yet no working Selenium tests. 

The SonarQube static analysis shows minor code smells relating to entity constructors used for testing and duplicated code across entities.
